This connector generates a configurable number of documents, all with random titles and body fields.

## Quick start

NOTE: This quick start assumes that Fusion is installed on the `/opt` path.

. Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/lucidworks/connectors-sdk-resources.git
cd connectors-sdk-resources/java-sdk/connectors/
./gradlew assemblePlugins

This artifact is now ready to be uploaded directly to Fusion as a connector plugin.
