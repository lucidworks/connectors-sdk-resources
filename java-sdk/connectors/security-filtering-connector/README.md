# Security filtering Connector

## Connector Description

- This connector generates a configurable number of documents, all with random titles and body fields.
- The connector also generates ACL Documents.
- Groups and users will be generated using the connector configurations.

### Access Control Fetcher behavior

- The fetcher was implemented in SecurityFilteringAccessControlFetcher class
- For each document, a document ACL will be emitted.
- The documents indexed by the access control fetcher will be stored in the collection: `{DATASOURCE_ID}_access_control_hierarchy`. There the `DATASOURCE_ID` is the id of the configuration.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/lucidworks/connectors-sdk-resources.git
cd connectors-sdk-resources/java-sdk/connectors/
./gradlew assemblePlugins
```

2. This produces one zip file, named `security-filtering-connector.zip`, located in the `security-filtering-connector/build/plugins` directory.
This artifact is now ready to be uploaded directly to Fusion as a connector plugin.

3. See the following [instructions](../README.md) on how to build, deploy, and run the plugin.

### Content generator properties

|Property Name| Property description|

| Total | The total number of documents to generate |
| Minimum number of sentences | The minimum number of sentences to generate per document, the random generator will use this value as lower bound to calculate a random number of sentences|

## Security trimming stage (Query time)

After index documents in the content and access control collections, we can run a search query to filter the results based on a username.
First, we need to add the `Security Trimming` query stage to the query pipeline and configure it.

Check the access control collection to review which users and groups where indexed.
